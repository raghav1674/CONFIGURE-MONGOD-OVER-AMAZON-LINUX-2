- MONGO DB IS A DOCUMENT ORIENTED NOSQL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE.

- MONGODB IS THE COMPANY NAME AND ALSO THE PRODUCT NAME.


- The data model in MONGODB is flexible , we can add , update new fields without changing the whole schema. 

- Each record is treated individually and is known as document and the collection of documents is known as Collection.

	 
          RECORD == DOCUMENT 
          TABLE  == COLLECTION 
	  DATABASE == DATABASE 


- MONGOD is the mongodb server program and mongo is the client program to interact with the mongod server.

  The basic difference is performance.
